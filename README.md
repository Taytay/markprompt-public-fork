Markprompt is a platform for building GPT-powered prompts. It scans Markdown, Markdoc and MDX files in your GitHub repo and creates embeddings that you can use to create a prompt, for instance using the companion [Markprompt React](https://github.com/motifland/markprompt/blob/main/packages/markprompt-react/README.md) component. Markprompt also offers analytics, so you can gain insights on how visitors interact with your docs.

## Documentation

To use the Markprompt platform as is, please refer to the [Markprompt documentation](https://markprompt.com/docs).

## Self-hosting

Markprompt is built on top of the following stack:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - framework
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - hosting
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - language
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS
- [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) - Redis and rate limiting
- [Supabase](https://planetscale.com/) - database and auth
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) - payments
- [Plain](https://plain.com/) - support chat
- [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/) - analytics

### Environment variables:

1. In the root of the repo, copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`. You'll be filling in those values in the next steps. **DO NOT CHECK IN .env.local.**

### Supabase

You'll need a Supabase account and the [supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli). 
To set up a new Supabase project with this repo, follow these instructions:
If you haven't already, sign up at Supabase and create a new project.

1. Clone this repo
2. `yarn install` (This repo uses yarn)
3. `yarn run supabase login` (login to the Supabase CLI)
4. If create a new project.
5. `yarn run supabase link --project-ref <your-project-id>`
6. Once the project is created, go to the Project Settings and find the API URL and Public API Key. Put those in `.env.local`
7. `yarn run supabase start` (starts local development)

We are just running this for the database support for now.

A note on local Supabase development: Theoeretically, you can use Supabase's local testing environment, but it's got some rough edges, especially with regards to settings and authentication. This needs to be improved.

### Database Schema Migrations

You need to create the local database schema and apply migrations:
1. `yarn run supabase db reset`
(The schema is defined as the first migration step in `supabase/migrations/20230401212257_init.sql`.)

2. To update the local types after making a schema change:
```sh
yarn run supabase_create_types_local
```

3. If you make any other changes to the local database schema using migrations, you can apply the migrations to the remote db with:
```sh
supabase_db_push_migrations_to_remote
```

1. If you make REMOTE changes, and want to see what you would need to apply to your LOCAL DB to get it to match, you can run:
```sh
yarn run supabase db diff --use-migra --linked
```

[More information about this workflow can be found here](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/6366).

### UpStash

Upstash Redis is used for rate limiting. (There is no local substitute for this yet, but this could be made optional later)
1. Create an account at [Upstash](https://upstash.com/).
Put the credentials in `.env.local`

### Auth provider

Authentication is handled by Supabase Auth. Follow the [Login with GitHub](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-github) and [Login with Google](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google) guides to set it up.

## Using the React component

Markprompt React is a headless React component for building a prompt interface, based on the Markprompt API. With a single line of code, you can provide a prompt interface to your React application. Follow the steps in the [Markprompt React README](https://github.com/motifland/markprompt/blob/main/packages/markprompt-react/README.md) to get started using it.

Also, check out the [Markprompt starter template](https://github.com/motifland/markprompt-starter-template) for a fully working Next.js + Tailwind project.

## Usage

Currently, the Markprompt API has basic protection against misuse when making requests from public websites, such as rate limiting, IP blacklisting, allowed origins, and prompt moderation. These are not strong guarantees against misuse though, and it is always safer to expose an API like Markprompt's to authenticated users, and/or in non-public systems using private access tokens. We do plan to offer more extensive tooling on that front (hard limits, spike protection, notifications, query analysis, flagging).

## Data retention

OpenAI logs data for "abuse and misuse monitoring purposes for a maximum of 30 days". Read more: [OpenAI API data usage policies](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies).

Markprompt keeps the data as long as you need to query it. If you remove a file or delete a project, all associated data will be deleted immediately.
